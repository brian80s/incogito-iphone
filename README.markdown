## iOS support

JavaZone 2010 supported iOS 3.1 and above.

JavaZone 2011 currently supports iOS 3.2 and above (we're using the media player component that was introduced in iOS 3.2) and therefore the app will not function on earlier models (e.g. first gen iPod Touch).

In all likelihood - when we reach the release for the actual JZ 2011 conference we'll be 4.0 and above - we have a fair few things we'd like to include that require 4.0. Still - that's a year after iOS 4 came out.
